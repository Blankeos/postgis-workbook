### PostGIS Workbook

Going through the PostGIS workbook by Quisheng Wu. Teaches spatial data management with PostgreSQL, PostGIS, and Jupyter Python.

I'm currently learning how to use PostGIS for an application so I'll be practicing how to use PostGIS with this resource: https://postgis.gishub.org/chapters/intro.html.
